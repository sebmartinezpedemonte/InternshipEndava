# Java Fundamentals - Internship Exercises

This document provides an overview of the key Java fundamentals I applied during my internship exercises.

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects:** Java revolves around creating objects from classes (blueprints).
- **Inheritance:** Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Methods behave differently based on the object invoking them.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods, restricting direct access to some components.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details to simplify code usage.

## 2. Data Types
- **Primitive Types:** `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`.
- **Reference Types:** Objects and arrays that refer to instances of classes.

## 3. Control Flow
- **Conditionals:** `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` for decision-making.
- **Loops:** `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for repetition.

## 4. Memory Management
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management to free up unused objects.

## 5. Multithreading
- Running tasks in parallel using Java's `Thread` class or `Runnable` interface for better performance.

## 6. Exception Handling
- **Try-Catch-Finally:** Mechanisms to handle runtime errors gracefully, preventing program crashes.

## 7. Platform Independence
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):** Java code is compiled to bytecode, making it executable on any platform with a JVM.

## 8. JDK and JRE
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Tools for developing Java applications.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Components needed to run Java applications.

## 9. Standard Libraries
- Rich set of APIs for handling data structures, file I/O, networking, GUIs, and more.

## 10. Syntax and Structure
- Every Java program contains a `main` method as the entry point:
  ```java
  public class MyClass {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  
## 11. Packages and Imports
- Organize classes into packages, and use import to access external classes.

## 12. Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- **Interfaces:** Define contracts for classes to implement specific methods.
- **Abstract Classes:** Contain both abstract (without implementation) and concrete methods.
